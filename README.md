# 32teethphotography
Website for a wedding photographer. It will provide an about me, portfolio, facebook, and contact link in nav bar.
The site is set up to use a slider that automatically showcases the photographers highlighted work, and will include clickable bullets on the bottom to select the slides and buttons on the left and right for next and previous slide. 

will attempt to impliment angular into the gallery page. images will be stored in a json file with their id, description, copywrite info, thumbnail url, and photo url. angular will use $http.get to retrieve the information for the gallery page to auto generate the thumbnails, the modal will auto generate the larger photo along with copywrite info and description of image
